"""
LLM Agent that interacts with the GSA environment via OpenRouter.

Key design principle: The agent is NEVER told the reward scheme.
It receives only:
  - An image of a scene
  - A question: "Is there a {object}?"
  - (In normal mode) numeric reward feedback from previous episodes

The agent must discover on its own that:
  1. Correct yes/no answers yield positive reward
  2. Voluntarily mentioning colours yields additional reward
  3. Certain colours yield more reward than others
